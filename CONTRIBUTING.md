## Contributing Guidelines

### What Can I Contribute?

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

### Working on an Issue

Before starting a substantial change, open or claim an issue and confirm the proposed approach with the maintainers. This helps avoid duplicate work and keeps contributions aligned with the project.

Issues intended for new contributors should explain the problem, expected outcome, relevant files or routes, reproduction steps where applicable, and how the change can be verified. Maintainers should label issues by scope and difficulty only when those labels are meaningful and the task is ready to work on.

For NSoC Project Kernel consideration, the project maintainer is responsible for keeping real, well-scoped issues for different experience levels, reviewing pull requests, and helping contributors understand the codebase. These are responsibilities described on the [official NSoC site](https://www.nsoc.in/); they are not a promise of acceptance into the program.

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards:
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update relevant documentation

3. Test your changes thoroughly:
   - Run relevant automated checks and report exact commands and results in your PR
   - Test the specific feature you modified
   - Check for regressions in existing functionality

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Short description of your changes"
   ```

### Coding Standards

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Follow modern best practices
